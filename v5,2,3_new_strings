The script must be installed in Amphetamine's Application Scripts folder.\n\nEach time the script runs, authentication will be required. The authentication prompt will say \"osascript wants to make changes.\" After you authenticate, the script will run. If you do not want to authenticate each Closed-Display Mode session, click the Skip button below.\n\nIf you skip installing the Closed-Display Mode script, you won't be asked about this again, and you may experience closed-display mode session interruptions when connecting or disconnecting your Mac's power adapter.
